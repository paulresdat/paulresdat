- 👋 Hi, I’m @paulresdat, I'm a programmer at Resource Data.  I like food and wine that warms the belly, sound that rattles the bones and solutions that absolve problems.
- 👀 I’m interested in C#, .NET, Python, and of course best practices and quality architecture/design principles that makes software sparkle.
- 🌱 I’m currently growing into a Rustacean. :D
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever comes next.
- 📫 How to reach me: by email or my work number
